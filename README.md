A web page to build and maintain your virtual zoo

I’m Luke, a 21-year-old college student at BYU studying Computer Science. I’m passionate about UX/UI design, web development, and product management, and I’d love to start my own software company someday. Right now, I’m interning at Mention, a startup in the BYU Sandbox program, where I’m focusing on UX/UI design and preparing for our product launch. I’m dating Amberly, and I love working on creative projects like writing songs, painting, and designing thoughtful gifts. I’m always looking for ways to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.
